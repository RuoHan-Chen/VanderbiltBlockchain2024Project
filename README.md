# Project Instructions

## Step 1: Watch Tutorial
- Watch the 18-minute YouTube tutorial that guides you through building a simple blockchain program using Solidity. The instructor walks through each line of code and explains its function.

## Step 2: Recreate the Project
- Use the Remix IDE to recreate the project as demonstrated in the tutorial.

## Step 3: Copy Improved Code
- After successfully completing the project, replace the tutorial code with the the code on this repo.
- I added some functionality like automatically withdrawing when the highest bidder changes.
- Also, I changed the end period to whenever the owner decides to close. 

## Step 4: Add New Functionality
- Add additional features to the project, such as:
  - A different auction mode
  - The ability to bid on more than one NFT
  - Or any other feature that challenges you and demonstrates your understanding of the code.
  - It doesn't have to be anything crazy just something to improve user experience like what I added.
  - I can see a couple weaknesses issues in the code that y'all definitely can fix.
  - Also make sure to implement the checks effects rule and read this doc to understand more about potential vulnerability

## Step 5: Remix Runthrough
- A video walkthrough on using Remix will be added soon for further instructions.

## Step 6: Submit Project
- Submit the project on this form https://forms.gle/8DTtaoZNDhAqvXV29/
